# Golang Microservice

## Introduction

### Hey GO-pher

This is a basic microservice architecture written in Golang to make my
grip stronger over microservices and golang.

## Featuring

This features authenticatioon services for now, which will be taken ahead by adding more services in future.

## Setup locally

### Using go

To setup this locally, follow along the following steps:

```bash
go mod download
```

This will download all of the required dependencies in your projeect.

```bash
go build main.go
```

### Now, you are good to go and run your project

```bash
go run main.go
```
